CPS on ZTK Guidelines
=====================

Disclaimer : this document is to be understood as a work-in-progress
RFC.

About the title, the Zope Tool Kit (ZTK) is a collection
of libraries that provide the core functionnality (no UI) of what used to be
called Zope 3. Zope 2.13 ships with ZTK 1.0

Code facelift
=============

Skins scripts
-------------

As of today, no new core CPS feature shall be added relying Zope 2
idiomatics, notably skins scripts and zpts; more precisely:

 - fixing a skins script or zpt is welcome
 - bringing additional functionnality to an existing one is not
   encouraged
 - creating new skins is almost forbidden, unless there's no
   alternative (for instance while CPSPortlets doesn't provide ZTK
   style rendering, it's tolerated to write new portlet widgets in skins).

Rationale : because of their monolithic nature, scripts are almost
impossible to test properly. There is almost no tests for these. They
are a great impediment to refactor and therefore to move up Zope versions.

CMF
---

Dependency on CMF must be kept as low and insulated as possible. This
will keep the problems climbing CMF versions to a minimum.

We probably should get rid of dependencies on CMF concepts that are
nowadays almost useless within CPS. Example: CMF's MemberShipTool and
especially MemberData aren't that useful in CPSUserFolder days. The
interplay between CMFCore, CPSCore and CPSDefault membership tools
is one of the worst areas of CPS.

About views
===========

Page flows
----------

TODO we need a good practice for redirections. Currently, the most
common way is to harcode the redirection in the view class code, which
would be consistent with annotation based configuration, but not with zcml.

Generalizing views
------------------
A plan must be made to decide what must be translated as a view, a
viewlet, or a content provider.

Most CPS views that use a template which calls ``main_template`` or
``master`` probably ought to be translated as viewlets and focus on
their own rendering, letting Zope machinery and CPSDesignerThemes do the
wrapping job. A good idea is to see what Plone is currently up to.

Through the web
---------------
Not so old and maybe current Plone documentation still suggests to
call skins templates and scripts from the view code, to get TTW
customization, wich is really lame.
We do need TTW customization, because that's a life-saver, and better
not wait too long. Coordination would be interesting

TODO : make a proper ticket out of this

Permissions
===========

After checking the practices with Zope 2.9-2.13 and BlueBream, the
following rules are suggested for CPS permission ids.

 - permission names are camel case
 - CPS base products permissions get directly under the 'cps'
   namespace.
 - CPS additional components' permissions go to the namespace of the
   package name they'd get if they started today from scratch on pure
   ZTK. This means that the package name is lowercase, and that the
   leading CPS is removed.

Examples:
---------
     cps.ViewStatusHistory (defined by CPSWorkflow)
     cps.rss.ManageChannels (defined by CPSRSS)
