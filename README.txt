CPSonFive is a product who contains all the integration between core
CPS functionality and Five. It's purpose it to provide a place where
this integration can be done so that the integration can be introduced
separately from the CPS products, thereby enabling integration without
requiring you to use the latest development version of CPS.

Currently CPSonFive provides the following integration features:

 - CPS form look for Zope3 schema-based forms.

 - Translatability for form error messages and drop down boxes.

 - A document_navigation widget that opens a CPSNavigation browser window.
